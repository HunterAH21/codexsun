# Task Management System - Development Steps

This document outlines the step-by-step process to build our **Task Management System**.
Weâ€™ll start with the **core foundation** and then gradually move to advanced features.

## ðŸ”‘ Steps in Building Task Management

### 1\. User Authentication

**Goal:** Ensure each user has a secure account.

* **Backend:**

* Setup user database (name, email, password, role).
* Implement registration, login, logout, password reset.
* Use JWT/session for authentication.

                      * **Frontend:**

* Forms for signup/login.
  * Validation (email format, password rules).
* Redirect to dashboard after login.

---

### 2\. Task Model (CRUD)

**Goal:** Create and manage tasks.

* **Backend:**

* Create Task model (title, description, status, priority, due date, assigned user).
* CRUD API endpoints (create, read, update, delete).
* Link task to **project** and **user**.

* **Frontend:**

* Simple form to create/edit tasks.
* Task list display.
* Basic actions (mark complete, edit details, delete).

---

### 3\. Projects / Boards

**Goal:** Organize tasks into meaningful groups.

* **Backend:**

* Create Project model (name, description, createdBy, members).
* Tasks belong to projects.
* API for project creation \& adding members.

* **Frontend:**

* UI for creating projects.
* Show tasks grouped by project.
* Option to switch between projects.

### 4\. Collaboration

    **Goal:** Make teamwork possible inside the system.

    * **Backend:**

* Add Comments model (linked to task + user).
* File upload support (store in server/Cloud).
    * Notifications (on task assigned, comment added, deadline near).

* **Frontend:**

* Comment box under each task.
    * File upload button.
    * Notification dropdown (bell icon).

    ---

### 5\. UI / Dashboard

    **Goal:** Give users an overview \& different task views.

    * **Backend:**

* Provide task filtering API (by status, due date, priority, user).

* **Frontend:**

* Dashboard page (summary: tasks due today, pending, completed).
* Views:

        * **List view** (simple rows).
* **Kanban board** (drag \& drop between statuses).
* **Calendar view** (deadlines).

    ---

### 6\. Tracking \& Reports

    **Goal:** Allow teams to see progress.

    * **Backend:**

* Store activity logs (who did what, when).
* Generate statistics (tasks completed, overdue, per user).

* **Frontend:**

* Activity timeline view.
    * Charts (progress bar, pie chart of completed vs pending).

    ---

### 7\. Advanced Features

    **Goal:** Add power features later once basics are working.

    * Recurring tasks.
    * Subtasks/checklists.
    * Time tracking (log hours).
* Gantt chart.
    * Integrations (Slack, Google Calendar, Email reminders).
* Analytics dashboards.

## MVP Recommendation

    1. **Step 1 \& 2 (Auth + Task CRUD)** â†’ Build this first.
    2. **Step 3 (Projects)** â†’ Add grouping of tasks.
    3. **Steps 4â€“6** â†’ Collaboration, UI improvements, reports.
    4. **Step 7** â†’ Only after MVP is stable.
