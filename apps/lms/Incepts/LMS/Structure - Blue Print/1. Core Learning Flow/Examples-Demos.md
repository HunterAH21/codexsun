### **1. Purpose**

- Let learners **see theory in action**.
    
- Provide **ready-made examples** they can tweak and run.
    
- Bridge between **Tutorials** and **Exercises** (study → try → practice).
    

---

### **2. Structure**

- **Topic-Wise Examples** → Every tutorial lesson has at least one demo.
    
- **Separate “Examples” Library** → One big page with all demos in order.
    
- **Searchable Examples** → Find example by keyword (e.g., “forms”, “loops”, “join”).
    

---

### **3. Features**

- **Live Editor (Try It Yourself)** → Edit code/concept and run it instantly.
    
- **Reset Button** → Bring back default example if learner breaks it.
    
- **Copy Button** → Copy example snippet quickly.
    
- **Side-by-Side Layout** → Left: code/example → Right: output/result.
    

---

### **4. Example Types**

- **Basic Examples** → Straight from tutorial (e.g., simple HTML page).
    
- **Applied Examples** → Slightly real-world use cases (e.g., login form, SQL report).
    
- **Error Examples** → Show wrong usage → fix it. Helps learners understand mistakes.
    
- **Challenge Examples** (optional) → Show half-done code, learner must complete it.

### **5. Add-ons**

- **Bookmark Example** → Save favorite ones for later.
    
- **Export/Download** → Learners can save examples offline.
    
- **Share Button** → Share example link with peers.
