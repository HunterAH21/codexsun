### **4. Advanced Add-ons**

- **Personalization** → Learners can choose which sources to integrate (turn off/on).
    
- **Difficulty Filters** → If pulling from HackerRank/LeetCode, show problem difficulty (Easy, Medium, Hard).
    
- **Smart Suggestions** → If learner searches “Python loops” → show:
    
    - Tutorial (your LMS)
        
    - Examples (your LMS)
        
    - External → HackerRank loop problems, W3Schools loop syntax.
        
- **AI Expansion (Future)** → Combine results → give summarized answer from LMS + external site links.

### **5. Placement**

- Inside **Search Bar Dropdown** → Show LMS + external tabs side by side.
    
- In **Results Page** → LMS results on top, external ones below (expandable).
